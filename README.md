# 🧠 Data Mining & Data Warehousing Practicals

Welcome to the repository for **Data Mining and Data Warehousing** practicals. This repository includes Python implementations of essential data mining algorithms, preprocessing techniques, OLAP operations, and ETL processes. 

> **Note:** First three practicals are tool-based (Weka/EDA) and do not include code files.
